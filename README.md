9th December 2013 - A Gentle Introduction to Web Apps...


Challenge
---------

Create a web application to calculate the cooking time for a Christmas turkey.

## Specs

* Your application should take the weight in kg from the path given to the web application, and return the cooking time in plain text. e.g. visiting <http://localhost/5.25> in your browser should return:

  ```
  X hours YY minutes
  ```
  
* Use the [NHS guidelines for turkey cooking time][NHS] to calculate cooking time
* Your application should comply with [PEP 333][PEP333] - [WSGI][WSGI], pronounced "whisky"
* Use ONLY The Python standard library - DO NOT use a Python web-framework to achieve the task

  (doing the task without a framework will give you a better understanding of how some of the frameworks operate if you need to use them in future)

   [NHS]: http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Healthychristmas/Pages/cooking-turkey.aspx#cooking
   [PEP333]: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/ "PEP-0333 Python Web Server Gateway Interface"
   [WSGI]: http://wsgi.org


##Hints

* The built-in [`wsgiref`](http://docs.python.org/2/library/wsgiref.html) module is your friend!


## Solution

You're surely not expecting me to give you that just yet! I'll try to make available by about 19:30.
